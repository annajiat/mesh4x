=How to use Mesh4x to simplify mobile data collection with JavaROSA=

At a glance:

To quickly get up and running with mobile data collection you will need:
• A mobile phone that support JavaROSA (you can see the list here http://code.javarosa.org/wiki/Devices)
• A SIM card with connectivity plan (we have plans to just require SMS in a future but for the moment this is needed)
• A choice of database to collect the information into MS Access, MS Excel, MySQL or Google Spreasheets for example

The steps are:

1. Define your survey form by designing your data source table (eg an Excel spreadsheet or Access Database)
   E.g. with Access :
     i.  Define a table, primary key is required.
     ii. Add data and save the file

     iii. Synchronize your database with the cloud server
	a. Download and run the Ektoo clien,  see the package here http://code.google.com/p/mesh4x/wiki/Mesh4xDownloads
	b. Point to your source on the left side and to the ‘cloud’ on the right hand side
	c. Press synchronize
	d. Check the cloud
	http://sync.staging.instedd.org:8080/mesh4x/feeds/MyExample/MyTable

	View source example:
 

	JavaRosa Mesh4x client read an atom10 feed with content as xform.

	http://sync.staging.instedd.org:8080/mesh4x/feeds/MyExample/MyTable?format=atom10&content=xform

2. Deploy and configure JavaROSA on your phone
  I.   Download JavaROSA with Mesh4x client, see the package here http://code.google.com/p/mesh4x/wiki/Mesh4xDownloads
  II.  Copy it to your phone application directory
  III. Open client
  IV.  Configure the Mesh4x server, Mesh name as follows

3. Download form definition

4. Sync data with the cloud

5. View imported data 

6. Update data on the form

   Select ‘save and send later’

7. Add some new data on the form

   Select ‘save and send later’

8. Synchronize the from the phone

9. All the information that was recently collected on the phone should now be on the mesh.

10. Go back to the desktop client and synchronize again

11. All the information on the server will be in your database
