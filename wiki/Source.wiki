#summary SCM Info
You can checkout a read-only working copy anonymously over HTTP using an SVN client. 


Depending on what you want to get, use the following repository URLs:

  * All of mesh4x code (all platforms, trunk, branches, everything): svn checkout http://mesh4x.googlecode.com/svn/
  * mesh4n (.NET) trunk: svn checkout http://mesh4x.googlecode.com/svn/Mesh4n/trunk
  * mesh4j (Java) trunk: svn checkout http://mesh4x.googlecode.com/svn/Mesh4j/trunk 

We have rumours contributors are working on Ruby and Javascript too, stay tuned!
